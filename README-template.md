## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS


### What I learned

I tried the Ben methodology but I didn't like it, it was the opposite of useful.
I used the ::after pseudoelement for the first time.
I learned how to modify svg images.

### Continued development

I need to keep on learning more about positioning, I spend too much time doing that.
I don't undertand how to put the container in the way I want in relation to the body or how to make the body fit the whole space...

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://https://codepen.io) - This helped me to make the colors for the svg.
